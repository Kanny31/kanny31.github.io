            <p>
                Skooza used <b>White Space and Clean Design</b> principle 
                well on their site. The website is clean and precise and it isn't over crowded. 
                It's background is black but there is a lot of space surrounding the image. Once you
                open the webpage you know exactly what is for sale.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Facebook did a good job at exemplifying the <b>rule of third</b> 
                design principle. Once you get to the login page your eye is drawn to 
                the sign in. If you were to put a grid over it, the page would still have
                a nice layout. The sign in page isn't cluttered and it is easy to navigate and
                find what you are looking for.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Simths uses the <b>Hick's Law</b> design principle because their
                layout is simple. From the very start you know which website you
                are on. You can search for the items you want to buy, and
                it shows you what store you would be purcahsing from. 
                There isn't a lot to read and you can find the store hours
                and the phone number quickly if you needed to.
